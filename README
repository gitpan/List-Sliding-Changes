List::Sliding::Changes version 0.02
==================================

This is a module faciliating merging two lists, where
one list is a sliding window possibly containing
new elements and the other list contains the known
elements.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Test::More for the tests

I tried hard to avoid the dependencies on Test::Inline, and I use
some cheap modified pod2test script to enable prerequisite checking
for my synopsis code - so if you rebuild the Test::Inline examples,
these tests might fail because of prerequisites not met.

The synopsis uses the following additional modules :

  Tie::File

  Finance::Banking::Postbank_de
